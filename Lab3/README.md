## Task 1 ## 

The first objective was to show how you can interface the NIOS processor with an accelerometer.

First we connected the Accelerometer (SPI) to export enternal connections:

And then we instantiated it in the top file, defining its I/Ps and O/Ps:

Then by copying in some existing code and building the project we got the following O/P:
